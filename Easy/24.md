## Explaintion

suppose we are given N = 5 ,

  Now we have to find factors of 1, 2,3,4,5 that will be 

  f1 = 1, f2 = 1 + 2 , f3 = 1 + 3, f4 = 1+2+4, f5 = 1+5, and then we try to sum them so ans will be 

   ans  =  f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 + f5 

          = 1 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 4) + (1 + 5)  // equals  21 

          now club alike terms

        = (1x5) + (2x2) + (3x1) + (4x1)+(5x1) // remains 21

        now this part does the main trick  and here I will do some rewriting as 

       = (1 x (5/1) ) + (2 x(5/2)) + (3x(5/3)) + (4 x (5/4)) + (5x(5/5))  //still remains 21

      # here I am doing floor division so example 3/2 = 1 and 7/3 =2

You can See answer remains same so here is our pattern that for any N 

  ans = (1 x (N/1)) + (2 x (N/2)) + (3x(N/3)) + ... + (Nx(N/N)) 

   # apply this on some value of N and it may become more clear 

 this is O(N) solution I hope you can code this on your own
